Hello, this is my first time writing on vim to what I assume is a text file. lets see how this goes

I found a tutorial for Vim, it has taken me through navigation and alot of other things involving
deletion and the sort

I am considering neovim for syntax highlighting but that would require me to hard commit to vim which I do not know I am ready for.

alright, im out for now, lets save this
